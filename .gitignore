# But unignore the .gitignore file and project source files/directories
!/.gitignore
!/requirements.txt
!/src/
!/*.py
# Add other project-specific files/directories as needed (e.g., !/README.md)

# Ensure common virtual environment directory names are ignored (this is implicitly covered by '*', but explicitly listed for clarity)
